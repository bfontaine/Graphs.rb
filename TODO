- Add Graph#|(*others) and replace Graph#&(other) with Graph#&(*others)
- Implement #parse and #unparse in GEXF module
- Move documentation in a wiki page
- Add RDoc comments
- Add 2 optional list argument to Graph#| and #& to list fields which
  should be inspected to generate the result (one list for nodes, one
  for edges). This is useful when the graphs have fields in commons
  (like 'node1' and 'node2') but others differents, like timestamps or
  stuff like that.
